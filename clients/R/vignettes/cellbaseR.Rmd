```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Loading the library

```{r, eval=FALSE }
library(cellbaseR)

```

## The CellbaseQuery class

Defining the CellbaseQuery object holding the config to connect to cellbase data

```{r , eval=TRUE}
cb <- cellbaseR::CellbaseQuery()
cb

```
This create a CellbaseQuery object which by default connect to the human cellbase database
and GRCh37 genome assembly, you can see the avaiable species and data for each species by running the cbSpecies method passing  the CellbaseQuery object you just created
```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sp <- cbSpecies(object = cb) # This will give you a list of dataframes corresponding
# to avaiable groups
# See the available groups
names(sp)
# Get the information about the vertberates group
vertebrates <- (sp[["vertebrates"]])
head(vertebrates)
# Later will see How to change the default species from human to your species of interest

```

## The CellbaseQuery Methods
In addition to the cbSpecies you have seen already, The cellbaseR package
provide many methods to query the cellbase webservices, they include:  
 
-  cbGene  
-  cbSnp  
-  cbProtein  
-  cbTranscript  
-  cbRegion  
-  cbVariant  
-  cbXref  
-  cbClinical  

In all cases the user is expected to provide the ids for the query and the resource to be queried, in addition to 
the CellbaseQuery object they created.For example, a query through the cbGene will look something like this
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cb <- CellbaseQuery()
genes <- c("TP73","TET1")
# the following query will fetch all the clinically relevant variants for these genes
res <- cbGene(object = cb, ids = genes, resource = "snp")
res

```



making a query through cbRegion to get all the clinically relevant variants in a specific region
```{r, eval=FALSE}

res <- cellbaseR::cbRegion(object = cb,ids = "17:1000000-1100000",resource = "clinical")
# to get the data 
res <- cellbaseR::cellbaseData(res)

```
Getting annotation for a specific variant


```{r,eval=FALSE}
res2 <- cbVariant(object =cb,ids = "1:169549811:A:G",resource = "annotation")
# to get the data 
res2 <- cellbaseR::cellbaseData(res2)
```
