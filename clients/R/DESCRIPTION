Description: 
    This R package makes use of the exhaustive RESTful Web service API that has been
    implemented for the Cellabase database. It enable researchers to query and 
    obtain a wealth of biological information from a single database saving a lot 
    of time. Another benefit is that researchers can easily make  queries about 
    different biological topics and link all this information together as all 
    information is integrated.
