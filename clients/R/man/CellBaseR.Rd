\title{A constructor function for CellBaseR object}
\usage{
CellBaseR(species = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A character should be     a species supported by cellbase
run cbSpeciesClient to see avaiable species and their corresponding data}

\item{host}{A character the default host url for cellbase webservices,
e.g. "http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbase/webservices/rest/"}

\item{version}{A character the cellbae API version, e.g. "V4"}

\item{species}{a character specifying the species to be queried, e.g. "hsapiens"}

\item{batch_size}{if multiple queries are raised by a single method call, e.g. getting annotation info for several genes,
queries will be sent to the server in batches. This slot indicates the size of these batches, e.g. 200}
}
\value{
An object of class CellBaseR
}
\details{
This class defines the CellBaseR object. It holds the default
configuration required by CellBaseR methods to connect to the
cellbase web services. By defult it is configured to query human
data based on the GRCh37 genome assembly. Please, visit
https://github.com/opencb/cellbase/wiki and
bioinfodev.hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbase/webservices/ for more details on
following parameters.
