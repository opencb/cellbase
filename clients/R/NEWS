This R package makes use of the exhaustive RESTful Web service API that has been
implemented for the Cellabase database. It enable researchers to query and 
obtain a wealth of biological information from a single database saving a lot 
of time. Another benefit is that researchers can easily make  queries about 
different biological topics and link all this information together as all 
information is integrated.
Currently Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and a total of forty eight species are available and 
many others will be included soon. Results returned from the cellbase queries
are parsed into R data.frames and other common R data strctures so users can 
readily get into downstream anaysis.
